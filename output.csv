The cost of capital takes in account the prevailing risk free interest rates, level of inflation, risks of creditworthiness &amp; liquidity for investing in private sector enterprises, and the risks associated with business ownership in general. Therefore companies which consistently deliver returns beyond the cost of capital are naturally better suited to provide a healthy risk-adjusted return and a scope for wealth creation. Investing in such companies over a 2-5 year horizon has a good compounding effect on the portfolio.However, a significant portion of the Fundastick Way strategy also focuses on the price paid for each investment. The valuation at which stocks are bought play a huge role in whether the business returns get translated into investment returns.
